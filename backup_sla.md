[ Backup SLA ]<br>
-[0] Introduction<br>
  -A service-level agreement is a commitment between a      <br>
  -service provider and a client. Particular aspects of     <br>
  -the service – quality, availability, responsibilities    <br>
  -are agreed between the service provider and the          <br>
  -service user.                                            <br>
-[1] Backup objectives<br>
  -Backing up the services is crucial part of the strong company.<br>
  -We provide best practices to backup services such as          <br>
    - (*) Database servers [InfluxDB][MySQL]                       <br>
    - (*) Ansible repository                                       <br>
-[2] Backup coverage -- (what is backed up and what is not)<br>
  -Our main focus is databases, because they contain important data.<br>
  -Monitoring services, dns, web app and web server is not our      <br>
  -perspective.                                                     <br>
-[3] RPO -- (recovery point objective)<br>
  -Due to high cost, our backup system is incremental. Incremental <br>   
  -backup system, restores data before the point where the loss has<br>
  -happened.                                                       <br>
-[4] Versioning and retention -- (how many backup versions are stored and for how long)<br>
  -As it is said, incremental backup system has possibility to restore<br>
  -the data fully before the "loss point". Older intervals are stored <br>
  -for 1 month.                                                       <br>
-[5] Usability checks -- (how is backup usability verified)<br>
  -We create daily test database backup on your server. The data     <br>
  -is encrypted and sent over secure channel to our data center.     <br>
  -You have possibility to restore the data for checks and usability.<br>
-[6] Restoration criteria -- (when should backup be restored)<br>
  -Restoring the data is first step when hardware or<br>
  -software failure happens and system shutsdown.   <br>
-[7] RTO -- (recovery time objective)<br>
  -RTO is maximum time objective that company is capable   <br>
  -of restoring the data. The RTO is not quite specified   <br>
  -and is more or less approximate. The reason we only     <br>
  -restore databases and ansible repository it requires    <br>
  -from 4-5 hours or more if we are dealing with giant data<br>
